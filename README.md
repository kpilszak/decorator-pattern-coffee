## General info
This project shows usage of decorator pattern.  
The main principle is "Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification".  
Decorators allow user to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.  
We define a component class which is extended by concrete component classes and decorator class.  
Decorator class is extended by concrete decorators' classes in which we have a reference to component class.
